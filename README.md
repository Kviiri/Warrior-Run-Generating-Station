MyAgent.py

Currently, the agent is only capable of generating new phrases by messing with the Brown corpus. Originally, I intended it to work with the Bible but the corpora provided by the NLTK lacked tagging for the Genesis so I decided to stick with the Brown Corpus.

Currently, there is nothing apart from producing random phrases picked from the Brown corpus with random, fitting word swaps based on the tags on the words. There is no adaptation or evaluation yet.
